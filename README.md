# ASSIGNMENT - 1

## What Was My Motivation?
My motivation is to improve myself and develop my first web page for assignment.

## What Was The Problem With Web Page?
* Structure of the HTML elements was missing
*  CSS styling was not properly implemented
* The website lacked interactivity, such as hover effects or buttons that respond when clicked on.


## How Did I Solve The Problems?
* I added proper structure to the HTML code by using semantic tags like `<header>`, `aside` ,` nav `, `<main>` and `<footer>`. This improved the readability.

* To address the issue of missing structure in the HTML
* I added attributes such as ``` alt ``` for images, ```class``` and ```id ``` for specific identification of HTML elements.
